# Implementation Details

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
  - Fast development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
  - Optimized production builds
  - Modern ES modules support
- **Architecture**: Component Architecture
  - Reusable, self-contained UI components
  - Component-based composition and hierarchy
  - Clear separation of presentational and container components
  - Props-driven data flow for predictable state management

### Backend

- **Framework**: NestJS with TypeScript
  - Modular architecture with dependency injection
  - Built-in support for REST APIs
  - Decorators for clean, readable code
  - Strong typing throughout the application
- **Architecture**: Onion Architecture (Clean Architecture)
  - **Domain Layer** (Core): Business entities and domain logic
  - **Application Layer**: Use cases and application business rules
  - **Infrastructure Layer**: External services, database access, and frameworks
  - **Presentation Layer**: Controllers and API endpoints
  - Dependency inversion: Inner layers have no knowledge of outer layers
  - Testable and maintainable codebase with clear boundaries

### Database

- **Development/Testing**: MongoDB
  - Local development environment
  - Quick setup for testing
  - Document-based data storage
- **Production**: Azure Cosmos DB
  - Globally distributed database service
  - MongoDB API compatibility
  - Enterprise-grade performance and reliability
  - Automatic scaling and high availability

## Project Structure

The project follows a monorepo or separate repository structure with:

- Frontend application in the client/frontend directory
- Backend API in the server/backend directory
- Shared types/interfaces between frontend and backend

## Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**: Using MongoDB for rapid iteration and testing
2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript across the entire stack ensures consistency
3. **API Communication**: RESTful endpoints connecting React frontend to NestJS backend
4. **Environment Configuration**: Different database connections for dev/test/prod environments

## Key Implementation Decisions

- **TypeScript**: End-to-end type safety reduces runtime errors
- **Vite**: Significantly faster development experience compared to traditional bundlers
- **NestJS**: Enterprise-ready architecture with built-in best practices
- **Component Architecture**: Modular, reusable frontend components for maintainability
- **Onion Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns in backend for testability and flexibility
- **Database Strategy**: MongoDB compatibility allows seamless transition from local development to Azure Cosmos DB production deployment
